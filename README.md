# 🎣 Fish & Gamble

A **multiplayer fishing and casino game** built in Godot 4 for a small group of friends.
Fish the island docks, upgrade your gear at the shop, and test your luck at the Blackjack table.
All game logic is server-authoritative — no cheating, just vibes.

> Runs in-browser (WebAssembly) or as a desktop client.
> Server auto-deploys to a Linux VPS via Docker + GitHub Actions.

## Quick Start (Playing)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dudeltron14/fish-gamble-game.git
git lfs pull
```

1. Open **Godot 4.6.x**, import `project.godot`
2. Press **Play** → click **Host & Play** to start a local server + join instantly
3. To invite a friend on the same network, give them your IP — they enter it in the Server field and click Login (register first)

---

## Running a Dedicated Server

```bash
# Export first: Project → Export → Linux (Dedicated Server)
./FishGambleGame.x86_64 --headless --server

# Custom port
./FishGambleGame.x86_64 --headless --server --port 7070
```

---

## Docker Deployment

```bash
# On your VPS — pulls the latest image and starts with auto-updates
docker compose up -d
```

SQLite database persists in `./data/` on the host.
Watchtower checks for new images every 5 minutes and updates automatically.

See [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md) for the full guide including Nginx WSS proxy config.

---

## Releasing a New Version

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

GitHub Actions will:
1. Export Linux server binary + Web client (Godot CI)
2. Build and push Docker image to `ghcr.io/dudeltron14/fish-gamble-game`
3. Attach web export to the GitHub Release page
4. Watchtower picks it up on the VPS within 5 minutes

---

## Adding Content

All game data lives in `.tres` resource files. **No code changes needed** to add new fish, rods, bait, or hooks.

```
# Add a new fish — just create the file:
src/resources/fish/my_new_fish.tres
```

The `ItemRegistry` autoload picks it up automatically at startup.
See [docs/FRAMEWORKS.md](docs/FRAMEWORKS.md) for the full guide.
